                    friend</b> nod to Modi</h2>

            <p>At the Sharm el-Sheikh Peace Summit in Egypt, US President Donald Trump called Pakistan's Army Chief his
                "favourite Field Marshal" as he thanked him and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for their role in bringing
                peace to Gaza.<br>

                "Prime Minister Sharif of Pakistan, and I have to say my favourite Field Marshal from Pakistan, who is
                not here, but the Prime Minister is here," Trump said, addressing the gathering aimed at signing a
                ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas as a visibly awkward Pakistani leader stood behind him.<br>

                Moments later, the US president praised India, calling Prime Minister Narendra Modi a "very good friend"
                who has done a "fantastic job". Then, in an awkward moment for the Pakistani premier, Trump turned
                towards Sharif and asked, "I think that Pakistan and India are going to live very nicely together,
                right?".<br>

                Caught off guard, Sharif smiled uneasily as Trump continued, "They are, they are... and they're two
                great... I tell you... leaders, great leaders as far as I'm concerned."<br>

                Later, taking the podium, Sharif thanks Trump for 'stopping India-Pak war'. The Pakistan PM said he
                would like to again nominate Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize for "saving millions of lives not only in
                South Asia but also in the Middle East".<br>

                "This is because he has brought not only peace in South Asia, saved the lives of millions of people
                there, and today here in Sharm el-Sheikh, achieving peace in Gaza is saving millions of lives in the
                Middle East," Sharif added.<br>

                Islamabad, on several occasions, has backed Trump's claim of ending the military conflict between India
                and Pakistan in May. The Sharif government even nominated Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, even though
                India has consistently maintained that the understanding on cessation of hostilities with Pakistan was
                reached following direct talks between the Directors General of Military Operations (DGMOs) of the two
                militaries.<br>

                India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terror infrastructure in Pakistan and
                Pakistan-occupied Kashmir in retaliation for the April 22 Pahalgam attack that killed 26 civilians.<br>

                India and Pakistan reached an understanding on May 10 to end the conflict after four days of intense
                cross-border drone and missile strikes. </p>

            <h2>Japan stun Brazil 3-2, record first ever win over five-time World Cup champions</h2>
            <center><img src="https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/10/brazil-ap.jpg?w=640" alt="cruppted" width="500">
            </center>
            <p>Japan staged a remarkable second-half comeback to defeat five-times world champions Brazil 3-2 in a
                friendly at a sold-out Tokyo Stadium on Tuesday, earning their first-ever win over the South Americans
                in 14 meetings. The match was a tale of two halves, with Brazil dominating the opening 45 minutes before
                collapsing after the break.<br>

                Trailing 2-0 at halftime after goals from Paulo Henrique and Gabriel Martinelli, the hosts capitalised
                on Brazilian defensive errors before Ayase Ueda&#39;s late header sealed a famous victory.<br>

                Takumi Minamino halved the deficit in the 52nd minute after Fabricio Bruno&#39;s misplaced pass allowed
                the forward to score from just inside the box.<br>
                With the home crowd in full voice, Japan pressed for a winner. Two minutes after Ueda&#39;s header
                struck the crossbar, substitute Junya Ito provided the decisive moment, delivering a pinpoint corner in
                the 71st minute which Ueda met with a powerful header after beating defender Lucas Beraldo to the
                ball.<br>

                “It was a blackout from everyone in our side in the second half. This is the highest level, if you fall
                to sleep in an entire half it can cost you a World Cup, a Copa America, an Olympic medal,” captain
                Casemiro told Brazilian TV Globo.<br>

                “It&#39;s just unacceptable and we must learn from it because the World Cup is just a few months ahead
                of us. We have to take care of the details because they can cost you everything.”<br>
                Brazil&#39;s early control came despite coach Carlo Ancelotti fielding a heavily rotated side compared
                to Friday&#39;s commanding 5-0 win over South Korea, keeping only midfielders Casemiro and Bruno
                Guimaraes and forward Vinicius Jr.<br>

                Guimaraes orchestrated proceedings in midfield and set up the opener in the 26th minute with a perfectly
                weighted through ball to right back Henrique, who beat the offside trap and slotted home.<br>

                Six minutes later, Martinelli doubled the lead with a composed finish after a clever lobbed pass from
                Lucas Paqueta, as Brazil&#39;s measured build-up play and high pressing left Japan chasing shadows.<br>

                However, Japan came out revitalised after the break and took advantage of Brazil&#39;s defensive errors,
                with a calamitous performance by defenders Bruno and Beraldo that could haunt them as they are fighting
                for a spot in Brazil&#39;s World Cup squad.

            <h2>Sam Konstas is the future of Australia batting, says Brett Lee</h2>
            <center><img src="https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/07/konstas.jpg?w=640" alt="cruppted" width="500">
            </center>
            <p>Former Australia quick Brett Lee is all in favour of his country retaining Sam Konstas as one of the
                openers for the Ashes. The 20-year-old&#39;s spot in the squad has been one of the hottest topics in the
                build-up to the series, and the ex-tearaway believes that he is the right man for the job. “I hope they
                go with Sam Konstas,” Lee told Sydney Morning Herald. “I think he&#39;s the future of Australian
                cricket. If I&#39;m coach or captain, I&#39;m saying, &#39;Sam, you&#39;re playing all five Tests. I
                don&#39;t care if you go duck, duck, duck, duck, you&#39;re playing all five Tests,” he added.<br>

                Pundits have been hounding on his vulnerability outside the off-stump. “I&#39;m a big fan of Sam
                Konstas, but he&#39;s learning Test cricket on the run,” Kerry O&#39;Keeffe would say. “These are two
                dangerous Tests. They&#39;re nickers Tests [where batsmen will edge to the slips], Perth and then
                Brisbane, a day-nightery.”<br>

                But Lee defends. “What that does is you&#39;re not looking over your shoulder if you nick off [edge the
                ball to the wicketkeeper or slips]. You&#39;ve got 10 innings and this is your summer. He might nick
                off, but he might not. He might get down on one knee and lap you for six.<br>


                Every opener, he said, faces such tribulations. But the best ones find a way out of it. “You think back
                to [Michael] Slater, [Justin] Langer and Hayden. The ball was still swinging around and they found a way
                to navigate through that.”<br>
                Lee&#39;s long-time colleague, Adam Gilchrist too sympathises with Konstas. “Maybe after the West
                Indies, a lot of people had written Konstas off … but I do believe he&#39;s well and truly still in the
                running,” Gilchrist said. “Sam probably needs some runs just to solidify that position. This selection
                panel and this group seem to try and show faith in guys they&#39;ve gone with and instil that belief and
                back them in. That&#39;s the way I suspect it might go at the moment,” he said.<br>

                Among the critics, though, was Mark Waugh. “The selectors will want to see runs from him in the next
                couple of Shield games. If he doesn&#39;t get a lot of runs, I think they might look past him. The man I
                would replace him with is Marnus Labuschagne,” he opined.<br>

                The Shield Games could do the trick, believes Nathan Lyon. “I wouldn&#39;t look too much into that
                [Konstas&#39; scores against Western Australia]. It was a very naughty wicket [at the WACA]. It was wet,
                there were some big divots and it was quite challenging, even though I got 40 runs on it. There are
                three more [Shield] games to play out before the Test side gets picked.” He has managed only 58 runs in
                three Shield games so far, but has scored a hundred against India A in <a

            <p>Israel will reportedly not reopen the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt on Wednesday and will
                reduce the flow of aid into the territory<br>

                Israeli media and Reuters news agency report the decision came after Hamas returned just four of 28
                Israeli hostages' bodies on Monday<br>

                The UN's humanitarian chief warns Israel it must keep crossings into Gaza open in order for "desperately
                needed" aid to be delivered<br>

                Tom Fletcher tells the BBC's international editor Jeremy Bowen the ceasefire deal must be "implemented

                The IDF says it has identified the bodies of the four hostages - they are named as Guy Illouz, Bipin
                Joshi, Yossi Sharabi and Daniel Peretz<br>

                making his way in a motorcade from Vatican City through Rome to visit Italy's President.<br>
                The head of the Catholic Church was driven through the centre of Rome escorted by the presidential guard

                "I express gratitude for the generous assistance this country offers to migrants who increasingly knock
                at its doors, as well as for its efforts in combating human trafficking," said the Pope, while citing
                the need for "constructive integration of newcomers into the values and traditions of Italian
                society".<br>

                Among those in attendance was Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, whose hard-right government has taken a
                hard line against illegal migration to the country, seeking to restrict departures from North Africa to
                Italy's shores while attempting to increase repatriations.<br>
                The 70-year-old pope thanked Italy for its care for children of Gaza, some 200 of whom have been treated
                in Rome's hospitals since the beginning of the war in 2023. He also defended the Church's position on
                abortion and euthanasia, recalling the need "to uphold and protect life in all its phases, from
                conception to old age, until the moment of death".<br>
                Close diplomatic relations between Italy and Vatican City — the world's smallest state that is
                surrounded by the city of Rome — are governed by the 1929 Lateran Agreements.<br>

                Built in the 16th century, the Quirinal Palace served for three centuries as a papal residence until
                1870, when it became the home of the first king of a unified Italy, Victor Emmanuel II.<br>
